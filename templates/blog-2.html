                                            activities, this park can surely be a family entertainer. You can watch the big cats of the park close enough in a safari cage and have a fun day boating in the artificial lake in the park. Take the forest road
                                            or stairs and hike towards the Gandhi <em>Tekdi</em>, a memorial built in the memory of Mahatma Gandhi. The toy train, <em>Van Rani, </em>is another popular attraction here, especially among kids. You can also
                                            visit the 2000-years-old Kanheri Caves to capture the Buddha relics. The undisturbed natural trails and the Jain Temple in the forest are also sure to make your visit a memorable one.</p>
